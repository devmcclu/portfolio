I am a game programmer with a focus on gameplay and tools programming. I love creating systems and structures to allow designers to iterate their game ideas fast and often in engine. I have a background in both Computer Science and Game Design (Graduating from Indiana University in August 2021), allowing me to easily work together with different facets of game development. I have been working on game projects for several years, and have a passion for free information, knowledge, and software. And of course, video games. Check out my [itch.io account](https://devlinmcclure.itch.io/) for my small game projects!
