I am a game programmer with a focus on creating tools to allow designers to iterate their game ideas fast and often in engine. I have a background in both Computer Science and Game Design. I have been working on game projects for several years, and have a passion for free information, knowledge, and software. And of course, video games. Check out my [itch.io account](https://devlinmcclure.itch.io/) for my small game projects!
